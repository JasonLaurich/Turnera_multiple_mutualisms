# Turnera_multiple_mutualisms
This is a repository for data and code pertaining to the manuscript "The genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms and mating system in Turnera ulmifolia"

This is just a first pass at editing the README file and uploading datasets and code for the project. I will edit this as I continue to experiment with github.

Below are a description of each file included in this repository.

1. Data files
a. Trait and seedset data.xlsx: an excel file containing phenotype data for all _Turnera ulmifolia_ plants. Second tab includes data from seedset experiment.

b. pheno.txt: text file containing data for all plants. This file is uploaded in the following R codes : GMatrix_Estimation_final.R.

c. seedset.txt: text file containing data for the seedest experiment. This file is uploaded in the following R codes : GMatrix_Estimation_Final.R.

d. Pedigree.xlsx: excel file containing pedigree information for all _Turnera ulmifolia_ plants. 

e. pedmat.txt: text file containing pedigree information. This file is used in the following R codes : GMatrix_Estimation_final.R, Bayesian_Heritability_final.R

2. Code
a. GMatrix_Estimation_final.R: (sample) code that fits G matrices and univariate Bayesian objects for all populations of _T. ulmifolia_. Also includes code for construction of G matrix for seedset experiment. 

b. Bayesian_Heritability_final.R: (sample) code that fits univariate Bayesian objects to randomized datasets for each population of _T. ulmifolia_ for the purposes of significance testing.
