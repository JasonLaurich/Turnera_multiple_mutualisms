# Turnera_multiple_mutualisms
This is a repository for data and code pertaining to the manuscript "The genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms and mating system in Turnera ulmifolia"

This is just a first pass at editing the README file and uploading datasets and code for the project. I will edit this as I continue to experiment with github.
